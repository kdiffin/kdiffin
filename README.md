### 🧠 grug
- htmx enjoyer/go stdlib enjoyer/js fatigued
- real name: davud
- have a bunch of react/vercel/baas/clerk (soy) infested projects but now im trying to branch out into other fields of programming.

---

### ⚙️ tools I like working with

`Go` • `HTMX` • `Tailwind` • `DaisyUI`, `Postgres` • `Docker` 

---

### 🧪 learning rn

- networking (cs168 @berkley),
- frontend/ui: HATEOAS, reactivity vs imperative (writing htmx makes me see the downfalls of imperative but it also lets me see the insane performance benefits)
- nand2tetris
- golang, gRPC, docker, trying to get into devops and self hosting on a vps
- building everything low-level, no training wheels, no libs
